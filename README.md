GooglePlaces
============

App based off of the tutorial: http://www.raywenderlich.com/13160/using-the-google-places-api-with-mapkit

-After finishing the tutorial I added an "All" button to query Google for any type of place, a button to 
rezoom back to the user location, a tableview to list all of the locations returned with their icons, and 
a segmented control to swap between the map and tableview.
